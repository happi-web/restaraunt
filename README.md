# Restaurant Homepage Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Restaurant Homepage** project! This project was designed to practice DOM manipulation by dynamically rendering a full restaurant homepage using just JavaScript. By the end of this project, we will have used JavaScript to generate the entire contents of the website, including various sections such as:

- **Home page** with dynamic content
- **About Us** section with restaurant history and team information
- **Menu** section to display various dishes dynamically
- **Contact Us** section with basic information

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to practice and enhance your understanding of JavaScript and DOM manipulation. You will learn how to:

- Dynamically create HTML elements using JavaScript
- Manipulate the DOM to build a full webpage without relying on static HTML content
- Use basic CSS to style the dynamically generated elements
- Organize JavaScript code into modular functions to maintain scalability and readability

## Key Features

1. **Dynamic Homepage**: The homepage displays a welcoming message and an overview of the restaurant, dynamically created using JavaScript.
2. **Menu Page**: The menu is dynamically populated with items from a predefined array, including starters, main courses, desserts, and drinks.
3. **About Us Page**: Displays a section with the restaurant’s history and introduces the team members with their roles and bios.
4. **Responsive Design**: The website layout adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring it’s usable on both desktop and mobile devices.
5. **JavaScript-Only Rendering**: The entire webpage is rendered and structured using JavaScript, with no static HTML outside of the initial setup.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/happi-web/restaurant.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd restaurant-homepage
   ```
3. Open the project in your favorite code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code):
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

4. Open the `index.html` file in a browser to see the homepage in action.

## Usage

Once the project is set up, you can interact with the following pages:

1. **Home**: The default page that displays a brief introduction about the restaurant.
2. **Menu**: The dynamically generated menu of dishes with categories like Starters, Main Courses, Desserts, and Drinks.
3. **About Us**: Learn about the restaurant's story and meet the team behind the scenes.

To navigate between sections, you can use simple JavaScript functions to switch content dynamically based on user interactions.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the basic page structure.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For DOM manipulation to dynamically generate content.
- **Git**: For version control and project management.

## Future Enhancements

1. Add functionality to interact with the menu (e.g., order items or display prices dynamically).
2. Create a dynamic form for customer feedback or reservations.
3. Enhance responsiveness and styling for better mobile support.
